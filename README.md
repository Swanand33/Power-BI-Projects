# Power BI Project: Student Data Analysis

# Project Overview
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard created to analyze student data from various colleges and cities. The dashboard provides insights into student GPAs, family income distribution, programming experience, and event participation. The goal is to support educational strategies and enhance student support programs by visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends.

# Goals
Evaluate Student Performance: Assess the average GPA across different colleges and cities.
Analyze Family Income Impact: Understand the correlation between family income and student performance.
Monitor Programming Experience: Track student experience with programming languages, particularly Python.
Understand Event Participation: Gain insights into student participation in various events and activities.
Analyze Expected Salaries: Compare expected salaries based on various factors such as GPA, family income, and event participation.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Number of Unique Students: Total number of students analyzed.
Average GPA: Overall average GPA of students.
Distribution of Students Across Graduation Years: Trends in student graduation years.
Python Experience: Number of students with specific months of experience in Python.
Family Income Distribution: Percentage of students in different family income brackets.
GPA Variation Among Colleges: Highest and lowest GPAs across colleges.
Average GPA per City: Cities with the highest and lowest average GPAs.
Correlation Between Family Income and GPA: Impact of family income on student GPA.
Student Participation in Events: Most popular events among students.
Expected Salary and Leadership Skills: Analysis of expected salaries in relation to leadership roles and other factors.

# Recommendations
Targeted Support Programs: Develop support programs for students from lower-income families to help improve their GPAs.
Python Programming Workshops: Organize advanced Python workshops to enhance students' programming skills.
City-Specific Improvement Plans: Implement strategies to improve average GPAs in cities with lower performance.
Effective Event Promotion: Utilize popular communication channels like WhatsApp and email to promote student events.
Enhanced Leadership Programs: Continue offering leadership development programs to prepare students for diverse career paths.

# Technical Stack
